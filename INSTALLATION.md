## Build the container

If you want to build the container and push it to your own registry, you have to update the vlaue in the `Makefile`, the variable:
```
REGISTRY_NAME=<your-registry>
# then run the following command, it will build the container and push it to your registry
make docker_all
```

*Remember to update image reference in the Helm values in `infra/setget/values.yaml`*
